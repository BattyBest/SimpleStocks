# SimpleStocks
Stock Trading Simulator too accurate for its own gameplay sake

# What you need
A Ti-84+ CE
A transfer program capable of transferring ti-programs (TILP for Linux and Ti Connect CE for Windows and Mac are good candidates)
These files

Simply transfer the program and open it from the prgm key. That is it. SSTOCK is written entirely in TI-BASIC and is designed to work at first launch.

# ...Modding?

Modding is a WIP feature. SSTOCKEV details how to mod, but that has not been actually implemented into the game. (You can make, at most, a name that will be recognized by the game.)

# FAQ

A: Of course, make a fork and then a pull request. I'll get to it. Eventually.

Q: Can I suggest a feature?
A: Make the feature and then a PR, I will maybe come up with a more convenient way.

Q: This seems very unproffesional...
A: Yes, it is a side project, I made it open source so that anyone can play it

Q: What does the slogan mean?
A: The best strategy in the game is to just buy a bunch of stocks and go into hibernation. Not fun, but realistic.
